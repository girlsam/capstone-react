### Newmate
Newmate is a site that helps roommates find compatible roommates. With 8 to 10,000 people moving to Denver each month, and with rent ever-increasing, Newmate solves the problem of transplants meeting transplants and transplants saving money. For this application, I taught myself React.js to build the front-end UI. I also built a separate API (hosted by Heroku) with Node.js and Express (and a PostgreSQL database). I loved the experience to learn a new framework, and I can't wait to use React for more projects.
